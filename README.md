> Mini Tiny Typo is a fork of [Tiny Typo](https://github.com/tetue/tinytypo), stripped down to its bare minimum, converted to Sass, and customizable.

A CSS base for web editorial content, ready for use, for readable web pages, on all media.

This microframework makes the typographic minimum necessary for the writing of web documents. Compliant with W3C standards, it's designed for all devices, naturally responsive, without forgetting print, multilingualism and accessibility.

Easy to use, it complements your usual reset to serve as foundation for your own styles.
